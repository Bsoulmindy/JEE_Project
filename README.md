# Installation

<p>You must install any IDE that can open Spring projects, like STS, VS Code...</p>
<p>You must have JRE and JDK</p>
<br>
<p>Inside pom.xml, change the version of java to your version (current is 8)</p>
<p>Take a look to application.properties, and change it.</p>
<br>
<p>And I guess that's it, you have now the web site!</p>
